Can be used for water metering, as in this case. However, this is one of the many other uses for this site and all these scripts. The site can work in conjunction with the ExLzFmySQL program to facilitate the entry of readings. The green button is for adding entries, which you can try out for yourself.
A separate page has been developed for printing, which displays values in reverse order and does not have extra styling.

Any row in the table can be edited from the pop-up modal window by clicking on the cell:
