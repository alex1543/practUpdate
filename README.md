Can be used for water metering, as in this case. However, this is one of the many other uses for this site and all these scripts. The site can work in conjunction with the ExLzFmySQL program to facilitate the entry of readings. The picture below shows the interface for adding records:

A separate page has been developed for printing, which displays values in reverse order and does not have extra styling.

Any row in the table can be edited from the pop-up modal window by clicking on the cell:

It is possible to add and remove files through the download manager:

Eventually. This is a very handy set of scripts that is a site that is very handy for editing MySQL database tables. The site is convenient for different purposes, it can work together with ExLzFmySQL.
